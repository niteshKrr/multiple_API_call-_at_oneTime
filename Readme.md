# MultiCall APIs ðŸ¤ ðŸ¥³

- If we have to call multiple apis at once, then we can't call them one by one. We have to call them at once. So, we can use multicall apis.

- To do so, we can use `Promise.all()`. It takes an array of promises and returns a promise that resolves to an array of the results.

```js
async function makeMultipleAPICalls() {
  try {
    const promises = [
      axios.get('https://api.example.com/data1'),
      axios.get('https://api.example.com/data2'),
      axios.get('https://api.example.com/data3'),
    ];
    const responses = await Promise.all(promises);
    for (let response of responses) {
      console.log(response.data);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

makeMultipleAPICalls();
```

### Note: 
- If any one of the call fails, then the whole promise will fail. So, we have to handle the error.
